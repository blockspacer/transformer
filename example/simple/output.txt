We have in file example/source.hpp 3 classes:
	Point2D does not have base classes :(

	Point2D has 2 fields:
		- float -> x (full name is math::geometry::Point2D::x)
		- float -> y (full name is math::geometry::Point2D::y)

	Point3D has 1 base class:
		- Point2D from file example/source.hpp

	Point3D has 3 fields:
		- float -> x (full name is math::geometry::Point2D::x)
		- float -> y (full name is math::geometry::Point2D::y)
		- float -> z (full name is math::geometry::Point3D::z)

	Shape does not have base classes :(

	Shape has 1 fields:
		- std::vector<Point3D> -> m_points (full name is math::geometry::Shape::m_points)

	THE END!

Enum Direction has type long:
	- math::geometry::Direction::UP has value 0
	- math::geometry::Direction::DOWN has value 1
	- math::geometry::Direction::LEFT has value -10
	- math::geometry::Direction::RIGHT has value -9
